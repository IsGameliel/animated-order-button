# Animated Order Button

This project is a simple, yet elegant, animated button that simulates an order completion process. It's built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and it's designed to be easily customizable.

## How it Works

The animation is triggered when the user clicks the "Complete Order" button. The animation sequence is as follows:

1.  A truck enters from the right, moving in reverse.
2.  A box appears from the left.
3.  The box slides into the back of the truck.
4.  The truck's trunk closes.
5.  The truck's headlamp turns on.
6.  A dashed road line appears and animates to simulate movement.
7.  The truck drives forward (to the right) and fades out.
8.  The button text changes to "Order Placed", and a checkmark appears.
